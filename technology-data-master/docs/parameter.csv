parameter,unit,description
investment,EUR/kW,"overall investment costs, if the energy output is not distinct, clarify with e.g. EUR/kWel or EUR/kWCH4"
FOM,%/year (% of investment costs),Fixed operation and maintenance costs (FOM) are given as a percentage of the overnight costs per year
VOM,EUR/MWh,"Variable operation and maintenance costs (VOM), if the energy output is not distinct, clarify with e.g. EUR/MWhel or EUR/MWhCH4"
efficiency,per unit,efficiency of a technology
